This is a MacroPad Desgined with help from HackClub Blueprints Hackpad. My Design uses 6 mx switches with 4 indicator leds and an info screen to quickly preform actions on my desktop and pull any interesing info on the the OLED Screen

This is my first time using KiCad to create custom PCBs as well as using Fusion360, I am using this as an opertunity to learn design software so I can eventualy start creating fully custom projects in the Future

!!Ignoure OPL_Kicad_Library, KiCad-SSD1309-... and MacroMachine-Kicad only look at MacroMachine dir as all realvent files are there
